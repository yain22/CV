\opening{Dear Professor Mirabela Rusu,} 

Please kindly accept an application from a very enthusiastic and self-motivated Ph.D. student for a postdoc position at the Laboratory for Integrative Personalized Medicine (PIMed). I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student, majoring in Statistics at Texas A\&M University. My expected graduation is on May 8th, 2021. I am eager to start the position right after graduation and join your team.

During my Ph.D. program, I have been explored and researched various Bayesian statistical models, with the purpose of application towards diverse industrial problems, arising from bio-medical, health-care, oil \& gas, wind energy industries, and the COVID-19 outbreak. I also had opportunities to explore real-world problems through internships at EMD Serono and Novartis International AG. Please visit the following websites to see my internship works: \href{https://sites.google.com/view/seyoonlee/home/projects/merck-group-summer-internship-project?authuser=0}{\textcolor{gray}{$\spadesuit$Click:Work at EMD Serono $\spadesuit$}}
\href{https://sites.google.com/view/seyoonlee/home/projects/novartis-summer-internship-project?authuser=0#h.dfc3zhswkx8m}{\textcolor{brown}{$\spadesuit$ Click: Work at Novartis $\spadesuit$}}. 

During the hands-on experiences, a common challenge that I have faced was the complication of the modern data structure such as enormous volume, large dimensionality, and multi-level structures. Broadly speaking, I tackle them with developing a Bayesian hierarchical model endowed with efficient computational techniques such as MCMC sampler or variational inference, and I usually develop relevant R codes from a scratch.

Now, I want to transit my research skill to machine learning in medical imaging as your postdoc. I believe that I can be successful not only due to my statistical knowledge but also due to my passion to enhance the quality of patients' life. Additionally, as still I have around six months to start this new job, I have time to study relevant literature to start a new project right after joining your team. Also, my previous skill set, dealing with complicated data structure, will help develop a new model, particularly when data has some spatial or temporal information.

I wish to research human disease during my lifetime. And I think that I should be trained by a domain expert like you, and this postdoc position is the best position to me to start my career. For the two references, please contact, Dr. Bani Mallick (bmallick@stat.tamu.edu) and Dr. Debdeep Pati (debdeep@stat.tamu.edu). Thank you very much for reading the cover letter, and I am looking forward to
hearing back from you.

\closing{Sincerely yours,}
