}{\em Apr 2022 -- present}{\textbf{Senior Biostatistician}}{\em Irvine, CA}
\item Studied various (Bayesian) adaptive clinical trials designs for the purpose of medical device development to get approval from government agencies.
\item Provided various biostatistical supports (e.g., power analysis, end point analysis, adaptive designs, etc) to treat cardiovascular diseases with main focus on atrial fibrillation.

}{\em May 2021 -- Apr 2022}{\textbf{Scientist - Modeling \& Simulations}}{\em Thousand Oaks, CA}
\item 
Developed Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics/Cox hazard regression models for Phase I cancer clinical trials of AMG160 to treat a metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).
\item 
Researched machine learning and deep neural network models to fit single dose data for subsequent simulation of multiple dosing scenarios.

\item 
Developed a Bayesian linear mixed effect model for patients who have wet age-related macular degeneration to predict best-corrected visual acuity over the maintenance phase and suggest a personalized dose regimen. The proposed model has been trained by actual patients' data from HAWK and HARRIER studies (Number of patients is around 1,800 patients). ; \href{https://sites.google.com/view/seyoonlee/home/projects/novartis-summer-internship-project?authuser=0#h.dfc3zhswkx8m}
